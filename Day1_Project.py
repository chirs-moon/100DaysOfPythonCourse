# This is a program greeting
print("Hi there! I will help you generate a name for your music band!")

# Here the program creates variable "city" and asks user for input
city = input("In what city did you grow up?\n")

# Here the program creates variable "pet" and asks user for input
pet = input("What is your pet's name?\n")

# Here the program creates variable "band_name" and changes its value to the sum of two strings "city" and "pet"
band_name = city + " " + pet
